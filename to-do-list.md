# WhoseEgg To Do List

## Completed

## To do

- Create video showing how to use the app
- Add video to home page of app
- Add warning if the data is in the future
- If you try to upload a non-csv file after uploading a file, you get a weird error on the prediction page
- Organize helper functions
- Organize github for future developers
- Add image during loading of swimming fish

Ideas for future versions: 

- Figure out a better way to fix the header so it doesn't cover material when the screen size changes
- Can we fix the WhoseEgg color text when hovered over?

- Add visualizations of new data compared to training data
- Create an MDS plot with training and new data
  - Switch to computing MDS on training data first and then projecting input data on the training data space
  - Scale the variables first
  - Switch to using Gower distance and all variables
- Try computing Cook's D and leverage

- **Add interpretation of the random forest probabilities (look up a nice interpretation)**
- **Read two papers from Dr. Dixon on calibration**
- Add visualizations of the data (both input data and training data with input data included)
- Add option to click on plot and show more plots (summary to input data features and individual to training data with observation)
- Figure out how to compute prediction intervals
- Add a download image button

- **Add comments on the interpretations of random forests (especially probabilities near 0.5-0.6)**
- Look into how to compute empirical probabilities and try out the model calibration technique

- Try using Google forms for input options â€“ could even embed it in the app or could use a conditional panel to create click through options for manual input
- Look into research on data input in apps
- Switch to using random forests with reduced features
- Try using weighting in random forests to account for imbalance in classes
- Look into the process the fish bioenergetics Shiny app uses to update frequently with more data and fish species

- Add a check for when a new dataset is uploaded
- Add formal tests
- Connect with GitHub actions
