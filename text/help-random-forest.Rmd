XXX Need to clean up...

The random forests used in WhoseEgg are the augmented models described in Goode et al. (XXXX) and based on the models developed in Camacho et al. (2019). Code for these models is available at XXXX.

- Three random forest models
  - All use 1000 trees
  - Trained using the randomForest package in R

- Response variables of random forest models:
  - Family
  - Genus
  - Species
  - Note: all three of these variables treat Bighead, Grass, and Silver Carp as one category
  
- Predictor variables: 
  - Egg_ID
  - Month
  - Julian_Day
  - Temperature
  - Conductivity
  - Deflated
  - Pigment
  - Egg_Stage
  - Compact_Diffuse
  - Sticky_Debris
  - Membrane_Ave
  - Membrane_SD
  - Membrane_CV
  - Yolk_Ave
  - Yolk_SD
  - Yolk_CV
  - Yolk_to_Membrane_Ratio
  - Larval_Length
