This page provides the ability to compute and display the random forest predictions for the egg data provided via the 'Data Input' tab. To obtain the predictions, follow the instructions in the sidebar panel to the left. The sections below provide tools for viewing and exploring the predictions.

See the **Table of Predictions** below for the taxonomic levels returned with the highest random forest probabilities for each fish egg. The columns of Family_Pred, Genus_Pred, and Species_Pred contain the taxonomy level with the highest random forest probability. The columns of Family_Prob, Genus_Prob, and Species_Prob contain the corresponding random forest probability. 

See the **Visualizations of Predictions** below for various visualizations of the random forest predictions. Click on the question mark icons to read a description of what is shown in the corresponding graphics.
