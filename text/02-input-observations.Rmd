- All variables (egg_ID and the 13 egg characteristics) must be filled in for WhoseEgg to return a prediction

- Observations with missing variable values will be excluded from the processed data for prediction but will be included in the final dataset for download without random forest predictions

- At least one egg observation is required

- There is no maximum number of observations that may be included, but the time it takes to compute predictions will increase as the number of observations increases
