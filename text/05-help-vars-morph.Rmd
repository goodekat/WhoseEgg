### Compact or Diffuse

**Definition**: Specifies whether the egg collected is compact or diffuse

**Spreadsheet Variable Name**: `Compact_Diffuse`

**Format**: `r paste(sort(unique(eggdata$Compact_Diffuse)), collapse = " or ")`

**Required Upload or Computed After Upload**: Required upload

**Random Forest Predictor Variable**: Yes

**Additional Information**:

Examples of compact eggs: The embryo entity is clearly identifiable. Note that it is difficult to see the identifiable embryo of the egg in the top right corner. When the egg was viewed under a microscope, the embryo would roll around within the membrane. If you look closely at the right side of the embryo, you can see the space between the embryo and membrane. The embryo is compact but nearly as big as the membrane.

<img src="../compact.jpeg" width="800">

Examples of diffuse eggs: The embryo is not in a tightly compact entity within the membrane. The membrane appears to be filled with smoke or the embryo material is scrambled within the membrane.

<hr/>

### Deflated

**Definition**: Specifies whether the egg is deflated or not

**Spreadsheet Variable Name**: `Deflated`

**Format**: `r paste(sort(unique(eggdata$Deflated)), collapse = " or ")`

**Required Upload or Computed After Upload**: Required upload

**Random Forest Predictor Variable**: Yes

**Additional Information**: 

Examples of deflated eggs. All these membranes do not have a smooth surface or are spherical. Notice the dents and folds indicating the membrane is smaller now than when sampled. Some of this may be due to broken membranes from egg handling or desiccation from the ethanol. Most eggs in the training data were not ripped or broken. The membranes appeared intact but shriveled due to water being sucked out by the ethanol during preservation.

Examples of eggs that are not deflated. Notice all the membranes are spherical and smooth. You do not see folds or dents.

**Spreadsheet Variable Name**: `Pigment`

**Format**: `r paste(sort(unique(eggdata$Pigment)), collapse = " or ")`

**Required Upload or Computed After Upload**: Required upload

**Random Forest Predictor Variable**: Yes

### Egg Stage

**Definition**: Stage of the egg when collected - either 1 through 8, broken, or diffuse

**Spreadsheet Variable Name**: `Egg_Stage`

**Format**: One of `r paste(sort(unique(eggdata$Egg_Stage)), collapse = ", ")` (where BROKEN indicates that the egg is broken and D indicates the egg is diffuse)

**Required Upload or Computed After Upload**: Required upload

**Random Forest Predictor Variable**: Yes

**Additional Information**: Below are examples of the stages. Most of these pictures of the stages are not great representations. Assessing the stage is accomplished best with the egg under a microscope, so that it can be moved around to inspect all sides and angles.

*All diagrams of egg stages included below are from Kelso and Rutherford (1996). Permission to use the images was granted by the American Fisheries Society.*

Egg Stage 1 (early cleavage): The blastomeres will look like prongs (typically 4) pointing in one direction. The arrows in the images point to the prongs. The top left is the best image showing the 4 prongs. They are not as pronounced, but the cleavage separating each blastomere is still apparent. The bottom left corner picture shows a side view of 2 prongs. It is difficult to get a picture looking directly into the prongs.

Egg Stage 2 (morula): The arrows point to blastomeres.

Egg Stage 3 (blastula):

Egg Stage 4 (gastrula): The arrows point to germ rings.

<img src="../egg-stage-4.jpeg" height="200">

Egg Stage 5 (early embryo): The arrows point to embryonic axis (spine and back forming). This is best described as a ridge line that sticks out of the embryo.

<img src="../egg-stage-5.jpeg" height="200">

Egg Stage 6 (tail-bud stage): Out of the embryonic axis, the head and tail will form a rounded end. The tail will start to protrude away from the embryo.

<img src="../egg-stage-6.jpeg" height="200">

Egg Stage 7 (tail-free stage): The tail continues to protrude away from the embryo and is no longer touching the embryo. The arrows point to the tail not touching the embryo.

<img src="../egg-stage-7.jpeg" height="200">

Egg Stage 8 (late embryo): The embryo is almost fully developed. Myomeres, eyes, auditory vesicle are all present. The egg is close to hatching.
