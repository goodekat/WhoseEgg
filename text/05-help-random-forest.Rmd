### General Information on Random Forests

Random forests are machine learning models that use an ensemble of classification trees (categorical response variable) or regression trees (continuous response variable) to provide predictions. The term *random* is used because randomness is introduced when each tree is fit. In particular 

### Random Forests in WhoseEgg

The random forests used in WhoseEgg are the augmented models described in Goode et al. (2021) and based on the models developed in Camacho et al. (2019). Code for these models is available at https://github.com/goodekat/WhoseEgg/blob/main/prep/rfs-for-app.md, and the models are available as RDS files at https://github.com/goodekat/WhoseEgg/blob/main/data/rfs_for_app.rds.

Three random forest models:

- All use 1000 trees
- Trained using the randomForest package in R
- All other tuning parameters set to 

Response variables of random forest models:

- Family
- Genus
- Species
- Note: all three of these variables treat Bighead, Grass, and Silver Carp as one category
  
Predictor variables: 

- Egg_ID
- Month
- Julian_Day
- Temperature
- Conductivity
- Deflated
- Pigment
- Egg_Stage
- Compact_Diffuse
- Sticky_Debris
- Membrane_Ave
- Membrane_SD
- Membrane_CV
- Yolk_Ave
- Yolk_SD
- Yolk_CV
- Yolk_to_Membrane_Ratio
- Larval_Length
