### Environmental Variables

**Day**

Day of the month when the fish egg was collected (formatted as an integer between 1 and 31, respective to the month)

**Conductivity**

Conductivity (microS/cm) of the water where the egg was collected

**Month**

Month when the fish egg was collected (formatted as an integer between 1 and 12)

**Temperature**

Temperature (degrees Celsius) of the water where the egg was collected

**Year**

Year when the fish egg was collected (formatted as YYYY)

### Morphological Variables

**Compact_Diffuse**

Specifies whether the egg collected is compact or diffuse

**Deflated**

Specifies whether the egg is deflated or not

**Egg_Stage**

The stage the collected is in

**Larval_Length**

**Membrane_Ave**

**Membrane_CV**

**Membrane_SD**

**Pigment**

Specifies whether the egg has pigment of not

**Sticky_Debris**

Specifies whether there was debris on the egg. 

Below are examples of eggs with sticky debris. In all pictures, the debris was adhered to the eggs. Some fish have sticky eggs to keep them from drifting.Most of the debris is wood but the top left shows sand can also stick to eggs.
