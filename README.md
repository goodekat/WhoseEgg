# Shiny Carp App

Repository to store the code associated with the random forest app for
predicting fish species

## To do list for app

  - Update to work for more than one prediction at a time
  - Add ability to download the resulting predictions
  - Create info page
  - Figure out how to compute prediction intervals
  - Return a warning if input variables are outside of training data
  - Add visualizations of new data compared to training data (to
    determine if their observations fall within reasonable ranges to
    avoid extrapolation)
