# Shiny Carp App

Repository to store the code associated with the random forest app for
predicting fish species

## Changes made

  - Added a comment in app describing how to turn “helpers” off
  - Added an error in R if day entered does not agree with month
  - Tried \<br\> instead of \\n for printing list in an error – didn’t
    work
  - Added figures from Carlos

## To do list for app

  - Overview page:
      - Create and add video showing how to use the app

  - Data input page:
      - **Print lists in the errors with row breaks**
      - Add visualizations of new data compared to training data
      - Look into research on data input in apps
      - Try using Google forms for input options – could even embed it
        in the app
      - Could use a conditional panel to create click through options
        for manual input

<br>

  - Prediction page:
      - Figure out how to compute prediction intervals

<br>

  - Download page:
      - **Add option to download csv or excel spreadsheet**

<br>

  - Help page
      - **Write variable definitions (include short definitions and

      - **Have tab with information on random forest**

<br>

  - Other:
      - **Prepare to meet with Mike’s students**
      - **Start writing the manuscript (see fisheries magazine and
        bioenergetics model)**
      - Figure out how to host app (Dr. Dixon)
      - Prepare slides for collaborator meeting
      - Add image during loading of swimming fish
      - Organize helper functions
