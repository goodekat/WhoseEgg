# Shiny Carp App

Repository to store the code associated with the random forest app for predicting fish species

## Changes made

- Change to date (instead of month and Julian day)
- Switch to using an Excel spreadsheet
- Reorder variables in data set and input options by category (group as: month to conductivity, qualitative egg characteristics, numeric egg characteristics)
- Change to computing membrane CV, yolk CV, and ratio

## To do list for app

- Improve on input of data:
  - Change ACGC to invasive carp in data
  - Add download button for prepared data
  - Add column for egg ID
  - Add checks to app and/or Excel
  - Allow options for multiple qualitative levels
  - Make a few versions of the app
  - Option to leave the rows blank where we fill them in
  - Look into research on data input in apps
  - Add option for input of individual membrane and yolk measurements
  - Could I create an option to input one predictor at a time with arrow buttons

- Update to work for more than one prediction at a time 
- Add ability to download the resulting predictions
- Create info page
- Figure out how to compute prediction intervals
- Return a warning if input variables are outside of training data
- Add visualizations of new data compared to training data (to determine if their observations fall within reasonable ranges to avoid extrapolation)
