# Shiny Carp App

Repository to store the code associated with the random forest app for predicting fish species

## Changes made

- Added comments about funding (XXX need to make sure I wrote this correctly)
- Added a link to Carlos’s paper (actual paper or ISU digital repository)
- Clarify opening sentence and include upper Mississippi river basin (XXX have Mike and Philip proof read)
- Add text about where the data is collected and to be careful using it in other locations
- Include statement about data privacy
- Checked how month acts if incorrectly added to app - all good - shows that a wrong level has been provided
- Fixed so I’m only considering the missing values for the key variables and not all variables
- Increased the font size

## To do list for app

- Overview page:
  - Create and add video showing how to use the app

<br>

- Data input page:
  - **Add warning about data that fall outside of training data**
  - Add visualizations of new data compared to training data
  - Look into research on data input in apps
  - Add a comment in app describing how to turn “helpers” off
  - Add an error in R if day entered does not agree with month
  - For lists in the errors – try printing as a table/data frame – or try <br> instead of \n
  - Try using Google forms for input options – could even embed it in the app
  - Could use a conditional panel to create click through options for manual input
  
<br>

- Prediction page:
  - **Add text explaining what is in the tables and figures**:
    - **Guide users through the results**
    - **Have a key message below each graphic**
  - **Add a note about the percent of missing data discarded**
  - Add text about being able to zoom in on figures
  - Figure out how to compute prediction intervals

<br>

- Download page:
  - **Add option to download csv or excel spreadsheet**
  - Add text explaining what will be downloaded

<br>

- Help page
  - **Write variable definitions (include short definitions and additional details for more complicated variables)**
  - **Add figures from Carlos**
  - **Have tab with information on random forest** 

<br>

- Other:
  - **Prepare to meet with Mike's students**
  - **Start writing the manuscript (see fisheries magazine and bioenergetics model)**
  - **Try out [shinyhelper](https://github.com/cwthom/shinyhelper) for adding question marks with popup messages**
  - Figure out how to host app (Dr. Dixon)
  - Prepare slides for collaborator meeting
  - Add image during loading of swimming fish
  - Organize helper functions
  - Check out [ISOFAST](https://analytics.iasoybeans.com/cool-apps/ISOFAST/) for ideas
