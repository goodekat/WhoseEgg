# WhoseEgg

![](www/eggs-in-a-row.jpeg)

Repository to store the code associated with the WhoseEgg R Shiny app for classifying invasive carp eggs using a random forest model. The app is available at https://whoseegg.stat.iastate.edu/.

## Tasks

### Completed

- Fixed flagged variable
- Added warning if the data is in the future
- Fixed issues with uploading non- csv, xlsx, or xls files
- Organized helper functions
- Organized github repo for future developers

### To do

- Create video showing how to use the app
- Add video to home page of app
- Add image during loading of swimming fish

## Repository Structure

**Folders**

- [`data`](data/): Folder that contains the datasets used by WhoseEgg (or used to prepare the data used by WhoseEgg)
- [`prep`](prep/): Folder that contains the code used to prepare the [training data](prep/01-data-for-app.md) and [random forests](prep/02-rfs-for-app.md) for WhoseEgg. There are also files for creating an animation of a [swimming fish](prep/03-animation-for-app.md), investigating the use of [MDS to identify new observations outside of the training data](prep/04-mds-for-app.md), and [testing the functions](prep/99-testing-app-functions.md) used by WhoseEgg. (Look at the .md files for easy viewing on GitHub.)
- [`text`](text/): Folder with R markdown files accessed by WhoseEgg to incorporate text in the app
- [`www`](www/): Contains the figures used by WhoseEgg

**Files**

- [`app.R`](app.R): Main R script that contains the server and UI for the app
- [`helper-functions.R`](helper-functions.R): R script that contains the helper functions used by WhoseEgg
- [`matomo.txt`](matomo.txt): Text file that is necessary for Matomo to collect user information from the WhoseEgg server (DO NOT REMOVE)
- [`r-requirements.txt`](r-requirements.txt): Text file with a list of R packages used by WhoseEgg that is necessary for the server to work correctly (DO NOT REMOVE)
- [`README.md`](README.md) and [`README.Rmd`](README.Rmd): README file for WhoseEgg GitHub repository with lots of helpful information
- [`references.bib`](references.bib): File with BibTex citations used in WhoseEgg

## Updating the App

1. **Clone WhoseEgg Repository into R Studio**: See [this](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) book chapter for help if this is new to you.

2. **Edit code and/or files as needed**: If the only changes that need to be made are updating the training data and random forests, you only need to adjust the code in the files [`01-data-for-app.Rmd`](prep/01-data-for-app.Rmd) and [`02-rfs-for-app.Rmd`](prep/02-rfs-for-app.Rmd) and save the new versions of the data and random forests. The code in app.R will automatically use whatever versions of [`eggdata_for_app.csv`](data/eggdata_for_app.csv) and [`rfs_for_app.rds`](data/rfs_for_app.rds) are in the repository [data](data/) folder.

3. **Commit and push the updates to the main branch of the repository**: You could also create a new branch while working on updating the app and then merge the new branch with the main branch. The WhoseEgg server uses the files in the main branch.

4. **Wait for the server to update**: This may take a while.

*If any new R packages are added to the app, their name must be added to the [`r-requirements.txt`](r-requirements.txt) file.*

## ISU Developers Only 

### Checking Matomo User Data

In order to access the Matomo user data associated with WhoseEgg, log in at https://trends.ent.iastate.edu/. Currently, only Katherine Goode has access. Contact websupport@iastate.edu to be added to the users who can access the Matomo data. (Must also have approval from Mike Weber and Philip Dixon.)

### Check Log for WhoseEgg Server

If there is an error with the WhoseEgg server, you can check the log by going through these steps (must have the appropriate access): 

1. Go [here](https://console.apps.nimbus.las.iastate.edu/) and login with okta.

2. Also make sure 'Developer' is selected from the dropdown in the top left rather than 'Administrator'. 

3. If you see a dropdown near the top, choose 'rit-pdixon-lab-carp'.

4. Click 'Topology' on the left. 

5. Then click the big circle. 

6. Then under the 'Pods' heading, click 'View' Logs'.

If you need to get access, contact researchit@iastate.edu. Currently, only Katherine Goode has access. (Must also have approval from Mike Weber and Philip Dixon.)

## Ideas for Future Versions

**Data Input**

- Add option for manual input of one observation (could try using a Google form embedding in the app)
- Look into research on data input in apps

**Methods**

- Add more visualizations:
  - Comparing input data to training data
  - Create an MDS plot with training and new data
  - Make plots interactive
  - Add plots comparing predictions with egg characteristics
- Interpretations of random forest probabilities
  - Add a nice interpretation
  - Add comments on the interpretations of probabilities near 0.5-0.6
  - Look into how to compute empirical probabilities and try out the model calibration technique
  - Read papers on model calibration:

- Add random forest prediction intervals
- Switch to using random forests with reduced features
- Try using weighting in random forests to account for imbalance in classes

**Format**

- Figure out a better way to fix the header so it doesn't cover material when the screen size changes
- Fix the WhoseEgg color text when hovered over
- Add a download image button

**Other**

- Add a check for when a new dataset is uploaded
- Add formal tests
- Connect with GitHub actions
- Look into the process the fish bioenergetics Shiny app uses to update frequently with more data and fish species
- Update functions and code to make more efficient
