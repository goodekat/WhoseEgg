  - Option to leave the rows blank where we fill them in
  - Look into research on data input in apps
  - Could I create an option to input one predictor at a time with arrow buttons
- Order the levels in the plot by highest to lowest probabilities
- Update to work for more than one prediction at a time
- Add ability to download the resulting predictions
- Create info page
- Figure out how to compute prediction intervals
- Return a warning if input variables are outside of training data
- Add visualizations of new data compared to training data (to determine if their observations fall within reasonable ranges to avoid extrapolation)
