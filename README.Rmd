# Shiny Carp App

Repository to store the code associated with the random forest app for predicting fish species

## Completed

- Emailed IT about time frame
- Determined how to host the app (IT or RStudio server)
- Changed to not having link to data validation explanation
- Changed the question mark to caption below the images
- Added next buttons to go from input data to predictions to downloads (or add get predictions to the instructions)
-	Changed error and warning messages to red/orange
-	Emphasized 'note'
- Listed app authors/contributors some where (me, Mike, Philip, and Carlos)
- Emailed copyright people about using the figures and added statement
- Added an FAQ to help page
-	Made the figures taller not to overlap
  
## To do list for app

- Meeting with collaborators: 
  - **Make a dataset with 5 errors for people to fix**
  - **Send email about trying out the app ahead of time (by March 18 or 19)**
  - Create a list of questions for the group
  - Prepare slides for meeting
  
<br>

- Manuscript: 
  - **Create an outline and send to Mike and Philip**
  
<br>

- Overview page:
  - **Convert text in tabs to html or R code**
  - Create and add video showing how to use the app
  
<br>

- Data input page:
  - **Add button to jump to help page**
  - **Highlight the search feature (especially for helping to find observations with typos)**
  - **Print lists in the errors with row breaks**
  - Add visualizations of new data compared to training data
  - Look into research on data input in apps
  - Try using Google forms for input options – could even embed it in the app
  - Could use a conditional panel to create click through options for manual input
  - Allow option for inputting Julian day
  
<br>

- Prediction page:
  -	**Change header names to not be underscored**
  -	**Add a download image button**
  - **Add visualizations of the data (both input data and training data with input data included)**
  -	**Add interpretation of the random forest probabilities (look up a nice interpretation)**
  - **Discuss interpretation of probabilities near 0.5-0.6**
  -	**Move all numbers on figures to right in summary plot**
  -	**Add option to click on plot and show more plots (summary to input data features and individual to training data with observation)**
  -	**Change wording on how the zooming can be done**
  - Figure out how to compute prediction intervals

- Download page:

- Help page:
  - **Edit definitions**
  - **Have tab with information on random forest**
  -	**Add buttons to easily get to the help page for the egg characteristics**
  - **Fill in and add to FAQ**

- Warnings/Errors:
  -	**Add warning if the data is in the future**
  -	**Add a check for when a new dataset is uploaded**
  -	**If you try to upload a non-csv file after uploading a file, you get a weird error on the prediction page**
  -	**Need to make sure all error/warning messages match – such as including the egg ID for factor levels**

<br>

- Testing:
  -	Need to test that different computer types work with Excel and csv uploads
  -     Some people were getting errors with the Excel file saying something about “subscript out of bounds”

<br>

- Other:
  - Add image during loading of swimming fish
  -	Is it possible to scroll through the tables? See if this option exists in DT.
  -	Can we fix the WhoseEgg color text when hovered over?
  - Organize helper functions
  -	The fish bioenergetics Shiny app updates frequently with more data and fish species
