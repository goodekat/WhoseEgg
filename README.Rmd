# WhoseEgg

![](www/eggs-in-a-row.jpeg)

Repository to store the code associated with the WhoseEgg R Shiny app for classifying invasive carp eggs using a random forest model. The app is available at https://whoseegg.stat.iastate.edu/.

## Completed

- Fixed flagged variable
- Added warning if the data is in the future
- Fixed issues with uploading non- csv, xlsx, or xls files
- Organized helper functions

## To do

- Organize github for future developers
- Create video showing how to use the app
- Add video to home page of app
- Add image during loading of swimming fish

## Repository Structure

Folders in the WhoseEgg GitHub repository:

- [`data`](data/): Folder that contains the datasets used by WhoseEgg (or used to prepare the data used by WhoseEgg)
- [`prep`](prep/): Folder that contains the code used to prepare the [training data](prep/01-data-for-app.md) and [random forests](prep/02-rfs-for-app.md) for WhoseEgg. There are also files for creating an animation of a [swimming fish](prep/03-animation-for-app.md), investigating the use of [MDS to identify new observations outside of the training data](prep/04-mds-for-app.md), and [testing the functions](99-testing-app-functions.md) used by WhoseEgg. (Look at the .md files for easy viewing on GitHub.)
- [`text`](text/): Folder with R markdown files accessed by WhoseEgg to incorporate text in the app
- [`www`](www/): Contains the figures used by WhoseEgg

Files in the WhoseEgg GitHub repository:

- [`app.R`](app.R): Main R script that contains the server and UI for the app
- [`helper-functions.R`](helper-functions.R): R script that contains the helper functions used by WhoseEgg
- [`matomo.txt`](matomo.txt): Text file that is necessary for Matomo to collect user information from the WhoseEgg server (DO NOT REMOVE)
- [`r-requirements.txt`](r-requirements.txt): Text file with a list of R packages used by WhoseEgg that is necessary for the server to work correctly (DO NOT REMOVE)
- [`README.md` and `README.Rmd`](README.md): README file for WhoseEgg GitHub repository with lots of helpful information
- [`references.bib`](references.bib): File with BibTex citations used in WhoseEgg

## Updating the App

## Checking Matomo User 

## Ideas for Future Versions

Data Input: 

- Add option for manual input of one observation (could try using a Google form embedding in the app)
- Look into research on data input in apps

Methods:

- Add more visualizations:
  - Comparing input data to training data
  - Create an MDS plot with training and new data
  - Make plots interactive
  - Add plots comparing predictions with egg characteristics
- Interpretations of random forest probabilities
  - Add a nice interpretation
  - Add comments on the interpretations of probabilities near 0.5-0.6
  - Look into how to compute empirical probabilities and try out the model calibration technique
  - Read papers on model calibration:

- Add random forest prediction intervals
- Switch to using random forests with reduced features
- Try using weighting in random forests to account for imbalance in classes

Format: 

- Figure out a better way to fix the header so it doesn't cover material when the screen size changes
- Fix the WhoseEgg color text when hovered over
- Add a download image button

Other:

- Add a check for when a new dataset is uploaded
- Add formal tests
- Connect with GitHub actions
- Look into the process the fish bioenergetics Shiny app uses to update frequently with more data and fish species
- Update functions and code to make more efficient
